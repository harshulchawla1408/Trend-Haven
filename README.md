<b><i>Full-fledged E-commerce website built using the MERN stack</i></b>
<br/>
This project is a learning-focused e-commerce platform for clothes shopping, developed 
within a 6-week timeline using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). 
The website features product browsing, user authentication, shopping cart management, 
and order processing, with a fictional payment systemâ€”no real transactions are made. The 
backend uses Node.js and Express.js for API management, while the frontend, built with 
React, offers a dynamic, user-friendly experience. The scope is limited to essential 
features, serving as a practical exercise in web development without real-world financial 
integration
